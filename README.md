## Disclaimer
Do this at your own risk. If you mess something up - it is your fault. I will probably not have any time to provide any support of you installing this. I just gathered all the info in one place. Keep in mind that if you have Windows or other OS on your machine, this installation will wipe it. Back everything up so even if you mess up you can restore.

## Pre-requirements
Computer running Mac OS Catalina. Legit Mac/MacBook or Hackintosh.
You can find VMWare and VirtualBox images for Hackintos Catalina on the web. I had a legit MacBook Pro for this. You need it to be able to download the Catalina installation.

And, of course, you need Asus Zenbook UX303LAB. I am not sure this will work with other UX303 models. You can give it a try if you want.

## DSDTs and SSDTs
**Do not** use my patched DSDTs and SSDTs. There is 99,99% chance they will not work with your laptop - even if you have the same model. Slight differences in BIOS settings and hardware configuration can render my patched DSDTs and SSDTs useless for your PC. 

Always generate new ones. The easiest way is: 
- insert bootable USB with Clover installed
- when in clover menu press F4 on your keyboard
- boot the OS from USB
- all original files will appear in `/EFI/EFI/CLOVER/ACPI/origin`

## Kexts
You can extract my kexts, but I recommend using the latest versions of kexts. The ones I packed worked for me on March the 18th of 2020 on Mac OS Catalina 10.15.3.

Kexts used: 
- ACPIBatteryManager.kext: https://bitbucket.org/RehabMan/os-x-acpi-battery-driver/downloads/
- AsusNBFnKeys.kext: I got it from one of the links above. If you cannot find the official repo, use this kext.
- CodecCommander.kext: https://bitbucket.org/RehabMan/os-x-eapd-codec-commander/downloads/
- DummyHDA.kext: I got it from one of the links above. If you cannot find the official repo, use this kext.
- HibernationFixup.kext: https://github.com/acidanthera/HibernationFixup/releases
- Lilu.kext: https://github.com/acidanthera/lilu/releases
- NullEthernet.kext: https://bitbucket.org/RehabMan/os-x-null-ethernet/downloads/
- USBInjectAll.kext: https://bitbucket.org/RehabMan/os-x-usb-inject-all/downloads/
- VirtualSMC.kext: https://github.com/acidanthera/VirtualSMC/releases
- VoodooHDA.kext: https://sourceforge.net/projects/voodoohda/
- VoodooPS2Controller.kext: https://bitbucket.org/RehabMan/os-x-voodoo-ps2-controller/downloads/
- WhateverGreen.kext: https://github.com/acidanthera/whatevergreen/releases

Kext locations:
All kexts need to be placed in /EFI/EFI/CLOVER/kexts (both in your bootable USB and later on on your HDD/SSD).

These kexts need to be placed in `/Library/Extensions/` directory on your HDD/SSD after installation:
- DummyHDA.kext
- VoodooHDA.kext

What is `AX88772C_772B_772A_760_772_Macintosh_Driver_Installer_v2.8.0` in kexts directory?

This is a driver for the Ethernet USB dongle.

## Important info
### Fn Brightness Keys Patch
This patch came with UX303LA.zip file from https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-asus-zenbook-ux303la-broadwell-edition.172279/

It doesn't work.
I used the `Fn Brightness Keys Patch.txt` patch from Asus DSDT patches.zip file found in https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-asus-zenbook-ux310ua-macos-mojave-catalina-installation-guide.224591/

### DummyHDA.kext for sound
It is in UX303LA.zip file from https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-asus-zenbook-ux303la-broadwell-edition.172279/

Do not use it. It does not work with Catalina. Use the kexts I provided - DummyHDA.kext and VoodooHDA.kext.

### USB Dongle drivers
Just install `AX88772_v2_8_0.dmg` found in kexts directory.
You might need to turn the SIP off and disable write protection for this: 
- Catalina SIP disabling guide: https://support.studionetworksolutions.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003839246-How-to-disable-Systems-Integrity-Protection-SIP-in-macOS
- Read-only issues on Catalina (workaround): https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/341349-read-only-file-system-catalina/

### HoRNDIS
HoRNDIS lets you use your Android phone as internet hotspot.

Connect your Android to a WiFi network or to mobile network. Install `HoRNDIS-9.2.pkg` from tools.zip. Plug your Android phone and enable USB Tethering. Your Hackintosh should be connected to the internet and it should be visible in the Network settings.

 You might need to turn the SIP off and disable write protection for this:

 In case of trouble, refer here: https://github.com/jwise/HoRNDIS/issues/102#issuecomment-540072360
 
 ### Internal WiFi
 It does not work. If you replace the chip, it might work. If you want to do that refer to this: https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-asus-zenbook-ux303la-broadwell-edition.172279/
 
 I did not do that, as I use my internet from my USB dongle and/or HoRNDIS.
 
 ### Repos for MaciASL
 Before patching read this first if you haven't: https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-patching-laptop-dsdt-ssdts.152573/ 
 You need three sources: 
 - http://raw.github.com/RehabMan/Laptop-DSDT-Patch/master
 - http://maciasl.sourceforge.net/pjalm/intel9
 - `file:///Users/[USERNAME NEEDS TO GO HERE]/Location/Of/Where/You/Extracted/Patches/Directory/From/UX303LA.zip/File`
 
 _Example for the third repo: `file:///Users/user/Desktop/Patches`_
 
 Instructions on how to add sources can be found somewhere here: https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-asus-zenbook-ux310ua-macos-mojave-catalina-installation-guide.224591/
 
 Download the latest MaciASL or build the one yourself. Either download from the links found here: https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-patching-laptop-dsdt-ssdts.152573/ ,  or read the section _Building the latest iasl from github_ form this link for building it yourself. The MaciASL.app that I provided should work fine.

## What works and what doesn't?
Everything works except: 
- WiFi (you can make it work if you swap out the WiFi card)
- TouchPad (probably patchable, but so far I had no luck with it)

Everything else works fine so far. I did not test HDMI. External and internal microphone works. GarageBand works flawlessly with my iRig 2. Keyboard works nice.
