# Introduction
This is not owned by me. I just gathered the software around the internet, and I grouped it here together, so that you know how to install.

I used this to install Mac OS Big Sur as a Guest OS inside VirtualBox on my Linux Ubuntu as a Host OS.

Everything I describe below can be found in the ReadMe files of the above-mentioned GitHub repositories. Read the ReadMe if you get stuck, or want to know more!

Basically, I installed Catalina, then upgraded to Big Sur.

# Installation steps (Catalina installation)
## Clone the `macos-virtualbox` repo from git
- Open the terminal and type `git clone https://github.com/myspaghetti/macos-virtualbox.git`
- Read the ReadMe and install all the dependencies

## Prepare the `macos-guest-virtualbox.sh` file by configuring your VM
- Open the `macos-guest-virtualbox.sh` file in your favorite text editor
- You need to edit the configuration in the `set_variables` function - the hardware configuration and Mac serial numbers

### Hardware configuration
I am just going to put my configuration here, so you can see how I did it. You do it for yourself.
```
vm_name="macOS"                  # name of the VirtualBox virtual machine
macOS_release_name="Catalina"    # install "HighSierra" "Mojave" or "Catalina"
storage_size=220000              # VM disk image size in MB, minimum 22000
storage_format="vdi"             # VM disk image file format, "vdi" or "vmdk"
cpu_count=2                      # VM CPU cores, minimum 2
memory_size=8192                 # VM RAM in MB, minimum 2048
gpu_vram=128                     # VM video RAM in MB, minimum 34, maximum 128
resolution="1920x1080"           # VM display resolution
```

### Serial numbers - EFI and NVRAM parameters - needed to get the iCloud working
You need to generate the unique set of information for your VM.

#### Generating unique serial numbers
- Clone the `osx-serial-generator` repo: `git clone https://github.com/sickcodes/osx-serial-generator.git`
- Read the ReadMe and install all the dependencies
- Go to the cloned repo, and execute the `generate-unique-machine-values.sh`. Ensure to pass in the device model if you want to. I did it like this: `./generate-unique-machine-values.sh -c 1 --model="iMacPro1,1"
- This will generate the required serial numbers, uuids, etc. Copy them to the `macos-guest-virtualbox.sh` inside `set_variables` functions on the right places

This is how the generated output of `./generate-unique-machine-values.sh -c 1 --model="iMacPro1,1"` command looks like:
(DO NOT USE THESE VALUES AND DO NOT COPY/PASTE THEM ANYWHERE, THEY ARE JUST HERE FOR THE REFERENCE)
```
DEVICE_MODEL:       iMacPro1,1
SERIAL_SET_COUNT:   1
OUTPUT_DIRECTORY:   .

```

The last two lines are the most important ones.
In your `macos-guest-virtualbox.sh` you would paste this like so:
```
DmiSystemFamily="iMacPro1,1"         # Model Name
DmiSystemProduct="iMacPro1,1"        # Model Identifier
DmiSystemSerial="C02ZV9YNHX87"       # Serial Number (system)
DmiSystemUuid="58F55DB6-770B-4979-B16B-4EBDCB9A42B7" # Hardware UUID
DmiBIOSVersion="string:MBP7.89"      # Boot ROM Version
DmiOEMVBoxVer="string:1"             # Apple ROM Info - left of the first dot
DmiOEMVBoxRev="string:.23.45.6"      # Apple ROM Info - first dot and onward
#   ioreg -l | grep -m 1 board-id
DmiBoardProduct="Mac-3CBD00234E554E41"
#   nvram 4D1EDE05-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B38C14:MLB
DmiBoardSerial="C02951301GUJG361M"    # stored in EFI
MLB="${DmiBoardSerial}"               # stored in NVRAM
#   nvram 4D1EDE05-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B38C14:ROM
ROM='%aa*%bbg%cc%dd'
#   ioreg -l -p IODeviceTree | grep \"system-id
SYSTEM_UUID="0BBAF458-D7F0-421B-99F2-7059E396CEF4"
#   csrutil status
SYSTEM_INTEGRITY_PROTECTION='10'  # '10' - enabled, '77' - disabled
```

BTW, I set `SYSTEM_INTEGRITY_PROTECTION` (the last entry) to value `'77'` on my machine.


This completes the preparation of the `macos-guest-virtualbox.sh`!

## Running the script
The script consists of the several "stages". Run each stage and follow the on screen instructions.
Here are all the commands that I ran (one by one - read the on screen instructions carefully!):
```
./macos-guest-virtualbox.sh check_shell
./macos-guest-virtualbox.sh check_gnu_coreutils_prefix
./macos-guest-virtualbox.sh set_variables
./macos-guest-virtualbox.sh welcome
./macos-guest-virtualbox.sh check_dependencies
./macos-guest-virtualbox.sh prompt_delete_existing_vm
./macos-guest-virtualbox.sh create_vm
./macos-guest-virtualbox.sh check_default_virtual_machine
./macos-guest-virtualbox.sh prepare_macos_installation_files
./macos-guest-virtualbox.sh create_nvram_files
./macos-guest-virtualbox.sh create_macos_installation_files_viso
./macos-guest-virtualbox.sh configure_vm
./macos-guest-virtualbox.sh populate_basesystem_virtual_disk
./macos-guest-virtualbox.sh create_bootable_installer_virtual_disk
./macos-guest-virtualbox.sh populate_bootable_installer_virtual_disk
./macos-guest-virtualbox.sh create_target_virtual_disk
./macos-guest-virtualbox.sh populate_macos_target_disk
./macos-guest-virtualbox.sh prompt_delete_temporary_files
```

Before the last three (3) commands (or before last line) your VM will shut down (or reboot, I don't remember).
When resetting or powering up the VM, immediately press Esc when the VirtualBox logo appears. This boots into the EFI Internal Shell or the boot menu. 
If the boot menu appears, select \"Boot Manager\" and then \"EFI Internal Shell\" and then allow the ${low_contrast_color}startup.nsh${default_color} script to execute automatically, applying the NVRAM variables before booting macOS.

This is needed to load and persist all the serial numbers and uuids so your iCloud will work right from the get go.

After that - you're done! You have a fully working Mac OS Catalina. Now le's upgrade to Big Sur.

# Upgrading to Big Sur
- Open the App Store and search for Big Sur
- Download it
- Do NOT run the Big Sur upgrade yet!
- Power down your VM.
- Go to VM settings in VirtualBox and: 
  -- disable network (go to network, and untick all adapters)
  -- change USB settings to USB 1.1 (go to USB in settings and set USB 1.1)
- Power on your VM and run the upgrade
- Wait for the upgrade to finish, and when it's finished, power down the VM and change back the above-mentioned settings (enable network back, and use USB 3.0)
- Boot back your VM again and you have Big Sur

# Fixing the Graphics
Notice you have only 7 MB of memory when you click on About My Mac (or even less) despite the 128 MB in the VirtualBox settings.
The goal is to bump it higher!

TBD

# Fixing the Audio
Notice that the Audio does not work inside your VM.

TBD
